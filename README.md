# **Course Overview**

**Humanitarians AI — COURSE TITLE** is a community-driven, open-access educational project where volunteers—often recent graduates, students, and early-career technologists—**learn by teaching**.
This course is a **work in progress**, evolving continuously through:

* Iterative outlines
* Community-created lecture content
* GitHub-hosted hands-on labs
* Real-time improvements using the **Humanitarians Courses GPT**
  [https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6920a81baeb8819185cc8100ce963e95-humanitarians-courses](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6920a81baeb8819185cc8100ce963e95-humanitarians-courses)

Each course aims to provide **ethical, accessible, inclusive AI education**, aligned with the mission of Humanitarians AI to *use AI for the greater good*—especially for underserved communities in education, health, nonprofits, and the arts.

# **Course Structure & Pedagogy**

Each Humanitarians AI YouTube course follows a **"Learn → Build → Teach"** cycle:

1. **Start with an Outline**
   Volunteers begin with a structured outline (like this one) and refine it collaboratively.

2. **Develop Hands-On Labs First**
   Before any lecture videos are recorded, the course repository includes:

   * Jupyter notebooks
   * Code demos
   * Data labs
   * Mini-projects
   * Applied exercises

3. **Use the Humanitarians Courses GPT**
   Volunteers generate:

   * Lecture scripts
   * Slides
   * Lab guides
   * Assignments
   * Explanations, demos, and analogies

4. **Produce YouTube Lectures**
   Once labs & notebooks are complete, volunteers record and upload:

   * Concept walkthroughs
   * Coding tutorials
   * Mini-lectures
   * Guest interviews

5. **Continuous Updating**
   New fellows and contributors continue improving the course, adding new labs, example datasets, and recorded demos.
